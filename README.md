# face-recognition

A face recognition model trained on the faces of my batchmates in a classroom setting. Also, includes a Flask API wrapped around the model. I wrote this in my Junior year of Bacherlors Degree. I thank David Sandberg for his implemention of Facenet paper in Tensorflow.

# WARNING

This code is hideous. Don't stare at it directly, might cause retroperistalsis.
